,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We honeymooned in Hawaii for two weeks the first being at the Hilton Hawaiin Village Resort.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,What a place.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is not one better towers but we were thrilled with everything it had to offer!
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens.
,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Check-in was quick and very easy.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The rooms were gorgeous.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,Everything you would expect from a Hilton and MORE!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,"We had done significant research on hotels in Oahu and I can say after seeing all the other locations we considered such as Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Marriot Waikiki and many others we were thrilled with our decision to stay at HHV."
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plenty of pool area (each tower has one and a Super pool in teh middle), teh property sits ON the beach!"
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A beautiful lagoon to take walks along.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,There were 21 restaurant and 22 stores right on site.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,You'd never have to leave if you so chose.
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fine dining Restaurants like Benihanna, Golden Dragon (chinese), Sergios (Italian), as well as Regular eating places like pizzerias, delis, hot dog stands."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,x,,,Shopping was a bit pricey compared to shops a half mile away but boy was the stuff nice!!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,I would recommend the HHV only because I don't know how you could have a bad experience here.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised!!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A couple of other places that were comparable but a little pricier.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in Ko'Olina.
ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We played the Ko'Olina golf course and it is well worth it!!!
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We also had the pleasure of going to a hotel called Ala Moana Hotel.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not on a beach but very elegant lobby.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No comment on the rooms as we did not see them.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you go to Oahu whereever you stay you HAVE to eat at Aaron's in the Ala Moana hotel.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The food is great but the service is incredible!

,,,p,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"You'll love it! This place is truly amazing! Yes, it is a bit out of the way for the Seattle hot spots in downtown, but that is what makes it extra special."
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice."
,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in."
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped."
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids (5 and 10) stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once.
,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier out one side.
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,The hotel is VERY secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,"The FREE parking garage (YES, FREE) is also secured pretty well."
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold!"
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,Just remember to GO EARLY.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,Not many tables!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,We went at 8:15 and it was very nice.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,That was awesome!
x,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There isn't all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melena's up the street (excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service).
x,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasn't bad at all."
x,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There is even a Trader Joe's market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertown's sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It was not bad at all, but it wasn't all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My advice, skip it.The staff at the front desk was always gracious and ready to help in anyway they could."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,,,"My only complaints:1) The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no DVD players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,,,We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,,,Bummer!
,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2) One elevator of the two was broken during our stay.
,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage."
,,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3) There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage.
,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thankfully, they had two carts sitting by the elevators, but only two.4) There is no real drop off place in front."
,,,,,,in,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,You just have to pull up and get dropped off.
x,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,"At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldn't even pull up in front!!!I would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys!"

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We had booked a double room so we went to leave our bags and explore the hotel.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Henry Newmann was at the bag check and immediately found us a room and got our keys.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,Who could ask for more?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I had contacted Henry regarding the hotel using his email address found in other reviews on this site.
,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,He had offered me and upgrade from a city vista room to an ocean view during our correspondence and WHAT A VIEW!
,,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The refrigerator didn't work, it was found to have a faulty outlet and fixed immediately."
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Service and food at the Italian resturant was excellent (Carolynn at breakfast was full of information and was a treasure).
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The gym has exceptional equiptment .
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Old San Juan was a $15 cab ride away.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There were plenty of chairs near the pool and we all won at the casino.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,Who could ask for more?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,I would stay again in a heartbeat.

,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is family owned.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,We felt very secure and safe here as well.
,p,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Every morning there is free breakfast and very polite assistance.
,,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The wife of the hotel owner also speaks very good english.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,Free Internet is also provided which is great.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,It is reasonably priced for its location.
,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It also has AC.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,It is a three star hotel.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,It was a very relaxing stay.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I first stayed at the Hotel Metro about 8 years ago and over the years have returned when visiting NY either for business or pleasure.
,,,,,,p,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,"There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location (right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop) to the price, and of course the wonderful staff."
,p,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt) and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished."
,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?"
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue?"
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,Stayed three nights at Sofitel last week.
,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We were underwhelmed with check-in.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First night there was no top sheet on the bed only a thin comforter.
,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available."
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The third night, same deal, no top sheet on the bed."
,,,,n,n,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that I'm guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good."
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We thought that was a little odd for a king room.
,,,,,n,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top."
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The clock radio was not a CD player and it didn't pick up one station.
,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.
,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday.
,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly can't see it from the hotel.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.
,,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We asked the concierge if she had a map of Reagan Airports layout and she replied no.
,,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is one restaurant across the street, a steakhouse, and three tourists on the street advised us not to eat there."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,,,"However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery."

,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"But when you arrive, the room was great."
,,,p,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thoroughly modern, great views (we were on the 31st floor)."
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.
,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use."
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Service staff were very polite and helpful.
x,,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We chose the express bus.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train (fast and cheap)."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Easy.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum (recommended)."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The dessert place was very good as well (also recommended).
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad."
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Around the hotel are many shopping places.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Also, many snack places if you like street food."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We have just returned from six nights at the New York Sofitel.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Whilst this is our first Tripadvisor report - our opinion of the Sofitel is based on comparison with a variety of Hotels across four continents.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Our 'Best' Hotels to date have been the Shangri La Singapore and the Bangkok Marriott Resort Spa.Until now we had not stayed at a Sofitel Hotel.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,So why has staying at the Sofitel caused us to go into print?
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The room was a good size with ample space around the bed and a separate seating area.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The bathroom had both bath and separate walk-in shower which we consider essential.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The non-smoking room was well presented, clean with good quality furniture, towels etc.The bed was simply the best Hotel bed we have experienced - just so comfortable."
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The room was serviced twice a day which meant when you dropped back to the Hotel (great location ??
,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,central but quiet) to have a midday shower (its hot and humid in July) you knew that the clean room and towels you were using would be replaced for the evening.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful."
,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Meals were expensive compared to local eateries.
,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We choose to to eat out for three quarters of the time on the basis of cost and also to experience New Yorkers food ??
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but when we did eat in the Hotel we found the food and service excellent.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Why was the Sofitel New York so different and so good?
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,But being at the Sofitel just made us ??eel??
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,good.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,The overall experience was greater than the sum of the parts.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,You will just have to try it for yourself.

,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.
,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal."
,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nor is the hotel filthy or a wreck as some of the reviewers have stated.
,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Its not in a great neighborhood, but hey, most of New Orleans isn't a great neighborhood and the bums are everywhere."
,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The hotel is small and so are the rooms, but everything is comfortable."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,I found that the photos posted on their site are pretty accurate.
,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We had the front desk call a cab for us on our way out to dinner and were offered the hotel car and driver for our return.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,After a brief chat with the people at the front desk about our anniversary / birthday celebration we left for dinner.
,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When we came back to our room we found a bottle of chilled champagne and a bag of goodies for us to eat.
,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It was such a wonderful surprise we went back down to thank them.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,I thought they were updating their standards.
,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The folks at the front desk were very poor on listening to our needs and were extremely uncooperative.
,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I finally got the attention of a young gentleman (Alex) to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.
,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It was so easy but the other women at the front desk were horrible on helping anyone and even one tried to be confrontational.

x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet.
,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,"Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Call us cheap, but we said no thanks and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The next morning (Saturday) at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window.

x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride."

x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Both places are highly recommended.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens.

,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Lobby has always been elegant but now it sparkled.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My room on the Club Level was brand new with a soothing updated look and excellent bedding.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Service at the Ritz-Carlton has always been excellent and this stay the staff were at their best.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,They know I love the fabulous chocolate chip cookies they make--and the night before I left--they had a tray of them sent to my room with a fond farewell written out in chocolate.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,"If I had to travel to San Francisco again, I would only stay at the Hotel Union Square if it were again the only place I could find."
,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Here's why:The hotel is old.
,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nothing wrong with that, however, little has been done to update the facilities to provide for modern conveniences, save for the free high speed wireless internet."
,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The water pressure was low, the bed was average, the decor was spartan, and the bathroom was quite small."
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket (along with a few drinks that were for sale) and was also meant to be used as a work space."
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It was not really useful for anything due to its size and number of functions that it was supposed to perform.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Again, the bathroom was small and the toiletries provided were average at best."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,"For some reason, I had a bag which included a Harlequin romance novel and a woman's razor included in my provided toiletries (thanks for the free stuff, Union Square Hotel, but I'm a guy)."
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The location was VERY convenient, both to BART, the cable car lines, and the F streetcar."
,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Many attractions are also accessible just by walking.
,,,,,in,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,"Although the location is great, not much has been done to insulate the rooms from the noise of nearby union square.I paid just under $200/night for this hotel."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,"If I hadn't been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, I'd say it was fair."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For any time of normal demand, I'd say that anything less than $120 would probably be a good value."

x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Yes, this was a big surprise to us."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We were told that other hotels in the French Quarter charge roughly the same price.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We thought a better idea would have been to park at one of the all night parking lots in the French Quarter for $10 to save $$$$.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"As I read in recent reviews there is difinitely a lang barrier if you do not speak spanish, but there is always someone around that does speak english."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I was travelling with my husband and step son age 14.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,We wanted to upgrade so we were closer to the beach.
,,n,,,p,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We asked when we checked in, the were unable to accomodate as hotel was at capa city...ok...so we wanted a late check out as check out is at noon and our flight didnt leave until 6 pm, clerk said that we would have to come back the day before we left to do that...so we did....again unable to accomodate as people would be checking in at 3 pm.....so again I wasnt happy ....but on the other hand the location of our room was perfect Block 35.....the only thing we needed the tram for was the beach.....everything else was a 5 min walk."
,p,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Restraunts---We only went to two Italian and French....both were very good and service excellent.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"Two swim up bars, there are usually enough chairs but if you want a cabana you have to get there earlier as they are taken fastBeach-- The beach is very large lots of chairs but again if you want a cabana get out there early."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The water is warm but fairly murky....not nearly as nice as the beaches is Cuba but still goregous.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Trips: Only took one trip...Saona Island...This island is breathtaking...a must see.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Beware as in the trip info it says that you can go snorkling but no gear is provided so if you want to snorkle take you own gear.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,For the elderly or overweight it is a task to get in and out of speed boat.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The trip was definately worthwhile.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just a few tips.
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".you dont need a blow dryer one is provided, if you want to buy rum and cigars either get them at the Hotel or go to the factory."
x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,".not much to choose from at the airport and a mickey is 14.00 us...if you want to upgrade or get a late checkout do that with your agent before you leave, dont forget your 20 per person to pay at the airport to come home,take some bug spray there are mostiqos didnt see many but got lots of bites, 30 pesos is 1 american dollar appx."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"Overall I would recommend this hotel lots of activities throughout the day to keep young and old busy and entertained, though for the single party type travellers this may not be the hotel for you as most activities are done by midnight......We will use the resort again when it is time to head back to the Dominican...."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Evidently mom was not such al light sleeper however.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,When the baby woke me screaming at 4am I wanted to go pick her up myself it took so long before mom and dad got up to respond to her cries!

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My biggest client owns one of the largest chains in the world.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I declined to stay at one of their proerties because I wanted something different.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,New York is a veritable smorgasbord of hotels ranging from sleezy to sublime.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I think I have stopped looking when it comes to New York.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,Going back to Bryant Park would feel like going home to a place of warm memories.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Travel these days can bring an untold amount of unpleasant surprises.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,But the place where you rest your head at the end of your vacation day should bring you peace.

,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.
,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queen's Beach (just two blocks from the hotel to the South)."

,,p,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana (Hawaiian for family).
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise.
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem."
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"However, if you plan to take an afternoon nap, bring ear plugs."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,This was the perfect place to wind down after experiencing all the sights and sounds of Amsterdam.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, the 10 minute walk to and from the hotel each day through the gorgeous Vondel Park provided us with a very scenic and peaceful way to begin and end each of our days."
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We also appreciated the size of our room and bathroom---larger than what we have experienced elsewhere in Europe at this rate.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The owners of the hotel couldn't be nicer or more helpful, gladly answering our questions and making sure our stay was a good one."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,If you are looking for a place away from the noise and action of the city this is it.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"We didn't always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,This was disturbing because the guest had reservations and were there for a wedding but for some reason there was no room.

,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,You hear no noise from other rooms or from the hallway.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Our room did not face the street.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ask for one that faces the interior.

,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The rooms are large.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,"(3) the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free."
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,(4) the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced (and delicious) caffe con leche and pastry.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well."
,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees.

,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,n,,,"The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you don't bring your laptop, using the hotel's computers costs 6 euros an hour."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro."

n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We felt more unsafe in Spain than in any other place in Europe.
n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where they're trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police don't care that tourists are being preyed upon."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, don't carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, don't let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door."

,,,n,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The hotel's air conditioning went out while we were in our meeting, and we were boiling, but they did nothing to accommodate us, or discount the meeting room charge."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for three nights in the beginning of January before heading off to Maui.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,p,,,Overall the hotel is nice and a good deal.
,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job.
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It has a boutique feel - not as good as the W but the prices aren't like the W either...The location is great, it's only steps from the beach and from some great shopping."
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes.
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous!
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The staff was also very nice.
,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The hotel has a laundry facility (which is a great perk), where guests can do their own laundry."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer.
,,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"With a little persuading the manager on site agreed to have my laundry sent out for free, which I thought was very nice."
,in,,,,,,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We also received a box of chocolates upon returning to the hotel for the last leg of our trip (a nice touch).I would not recommend having breakfast at the hotel.
,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There are a lot of breakfast options in Waikiki and unfortunately Waikiki Parc doesn't really stand up.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,For a good breakfast right on the beach check out Duke's (less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel).
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,If you're in the mood to splurge the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel) has a great breakfast but it is pricey.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"If you're looking for a reasonably priced nice hotel steps away from the beach, I would recommend staying at the Waikiki Parc."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,I didn't find it quite so fantastic as some of the reviews i read.
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The room was very small with an even smaller bathroom(although it had just been refurbished) the air-con unit would blow out air, but not very cold air and therefore never switched off."
,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hot water seemed quite a scare commodity, if you washed mid-afternoon you were alright!"
,,x,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Having said that, the hotel is in a nice quiet spot, with the metro station only 50 yards away, the reception did speak some English which is always handy."
,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The breakfast is extra (8.5euro)not a huge choice, 1 roll, 1 croissant each and some ham and cheese, tea and coffee etc."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"Not having stayed in any other hotel in Paris I did not have anything to judge it on, but if we went again i think i would look around first."

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We stayed here from the 10th January for 3 nights and the last leg of our Honeymoon.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We breezed through US immigration and our cases were there as we approached the carousel.
,,in,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Outside a cab was ready to take us to the Vitale, we arrived there within an hour of touching down, to be greated by a member of staff who clearly had more important customers than us, she simply told us that our room wasn't ready and that nothing could be guarenteed before 3.00pm, it was currently 12.30.After a long journey I expected a better welcome, afterall the hotel know which flight you're on and when to expect you."
,,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed.
,,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"In a country which is well known for it's customer focussed service we were a bit disappointed to be greeted by this attitude.I asked if we could wait with a drink in reception, the answer was no!"
,,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didn't tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable."
,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We were offered a room a the 4th floor or, an hour later, our room on the 7th floor would ready, we waited the extra hour in the bar.Room was ok, a partial bridge view although I was expecting a habour front room, it was comfortable enough and the bed linen was excellent, the room wasn't as big as I was expecting either."
,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good.
p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We ate in the Americano on our last evening which was buzzing with an afterwork crowd, the restuarant too was busy, the wine list was good and the food was very good."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, there's nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar."
,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,ip,,,,,"We would stay there again as the hotel, bar and restuarant are all very good lively places, it's just a shame that in the last place of our Honeymoon we were greeted by such an abrasive staff member, maybe she should look for a career which isn't customer facing."

,,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Security is also very evident and appreciated.
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant.
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu.
,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Portions were huge and I'm not sure any of us were able to finish.

,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"good liquor selection; self-serve, soft-serve ice cream at the outdoor bars."
,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Bad: Front desk disorganized (where do the lines begin??)
,n,n,,,n,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"and front desk staff not at all friendly...very polite and professional, but cold and unapologetic; groundskeeping staff too noisy early in morning; cascade pool area was smaller to very crowded...no secluded/quiet areas; internet is NOT free, regardless of what it says in the room directory; food was ok, but all started to taste the same...last night's lobster bisque was the next day's lunch buffet soup, etc; good attempt at an upscale menu, but the food never quite tasted up to par...best dishes were the ones that had some spice or marinade, like mexican or caribbean (it's what they know/do best); Quisqueya (gourmet) restaurant had the worst service of all restaurants...the other restaurants, even the buffets, all had 3 cutlery services at each place setting (appetizer, entree, dessert) so each setting was removed after being used...the gourmet restaurant had only once setting per person and the waiter/bus boy (we were never sure who was who) took the dirty silver off the plate and put it on the table to be used for the next course...yuck...this happened on all 3 visits to the Quisqueya;The Ugly; It took 4 days to get a room change due to the staff noise...middle of the night bottle recycling outside our window...and the shower was broken in our new room...the Honeymoon Suite!;"
in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"most clientele were solidly middle-class Americans and Canadians...a few chic Europeans, North and South Americans...more than a few lower middle-class people (re: tattos on the men and the women, mullet haircuts, swearing every other sentence...mostly Americans); mosquitos and sand fleas were bad so spray no matter where you go, even in the theater and indoor restaurants, and if allergic to sand fleas like my husband...bring Benedryl for the itch!"

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I had very high expectations from what I had read about the resort in the Internet.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,I soon discovered things were a bit different.
,,,,,,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,in,,,,,"First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ($120 round trip for 2 adults)."
,,n,p,,,p,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The building and the bungalows are very pretty as well as the pool area and the mountain view (it's the rain forest called Yunque that can be seen from the pool area) sadly, the outdoor lobby where the main desk is located is just simply too hot, I was sweating heavy while waiting in line to be checked in (also long line at check out since express check out from room TV was not available) and nobody offered us any refreshment or water, also the desk agents did not look very happy to be working in those conditions."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Restaurants are buffet style and a la carte.
,in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A la carte restaurants need reservations in advance and if the place is crowded you won't be able to get any reservation during the whole stay.
,ip,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,I had a good dinner at Bamboo (japanese) one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay.
,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The buffet style restaurants( Caribeno and Toscano) are disappointing to say the least.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club."
,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed."
,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Concierge was never available during the evening and the front desk was too overwhelmed with guests unable to help us at any time.
n,,,,,,,n,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,There is no free shuttle bus to Luquillo Beach which is about 10 minutes from the resort and simply mediocre nightlife inside the resort and not much too do in the municipality or province of Rio Grande where the resort is located (you have no choice but to pay a taxi $140 to enjoy San Juan's exciting nightlife ).

,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"It's also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macy's are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place."
,,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin!
,,,,,p,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldn't agree more with them.

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,p,,,,,"As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"By the way, I read somewhere that the place was overcrowded with locals paying only a small daily fee to get in."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort."
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,x,,,,,"A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all."
