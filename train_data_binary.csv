0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,Location could not be better - you're right in the middle of the centre but we were never disturbed by noise since the rooms are sound-proof.I was on a work trip so only managed to check out the rooftop pool once but it was so lovely sitting on the deck with a cocktail.
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,The views of the city were great and it was so quiet from where we were - you would forget you were in a busy city.I had a full body massage which was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep at dinner later on!We will be going back next year and so will our clients - everyone loves it!

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"We must have just been unlucky with our experience of Paris, because what should have been a lovely time was ruined by at least 3 encounters of very rude Parisians and very expensive prices."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,[expect to pay at least ?4-?5 for a beer and ?4 for a small wine most cafe/bars]But it was completely outweighed by the fact that the Hotel was a pleasant haven to rest a weary head.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,"The bed was the most comfortable I have stayed on.The only gripe I have about it was that there were no Tea and Coffee making facilities, and being an avid tea drinker and one who takes ages to get ready whilst consuming at least 4 cups doing so, was a disappointment."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,The other thing...[and I feel awful having to say this because nobody else has] ...is that breakfast was a little uncomfortable [ bit too intimate! ]
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,as we had to keep sharing a table with someone because the room was so tiny [ a converted cellar I think] and there was a maximum number of tables- so if everyone came down at once in the morning it would be chaos!!!
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,The lady waitress was a bit slow on the uptake and didnt understand much of what we were saying but we just didnt let it get to us.Nevertheless this hotel is good value for money and I agree with most of the comments made and the manager has done his best to make sure nobody has a bad time.

0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room.
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I was advised to take a taxi to the hotel rather than the bus as, since Katrina, the buses in the area of the train station/arena/Superdome are irregular."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"There isn't much in the train station, but there is a Subway restaurant, some sort of coffee shop (which may be attached to the Subway), a small gift shop and both Amtrak and Greyhound ticket counters."

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Mostly the sidewalks are being rebuilt.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I didn't have a problem with the construction in the city and I came down mainly because NOLa needs support.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Upon arrival at the Marriott, I knew things were not going to be so swell."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"First, there were two uniformed associates outside, a doorman and a bellman."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"While one opened my door, neither of them got my bags out of the cab, nor did they offer a single female assistance into the hotel."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Strike one.
1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Upon entering, the entire lobby is under construction, so you have to lug your stuff up an escalator to the temporary lobby on the second floor."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Let me explain.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I have no problem with renovations.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"I checked and double checked, and called Marriott's Platinum desk and asked them to verify that no mention was made."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,There was nothing.I checked in.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Actually, I was one day early but since the hotel was about 17% occupied, it wasn't a problem."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I was given a room in the river tower with a view of the other tower and pool.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,The pools are closed for repair.
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"Again, I was not informed of this in advance, nor at check-in!"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"The Concierge lounge, access to which I receive due to my frequency of Marriott-branded use, was across the hotel resulting in a trip down the elevator, across the lobby and back up."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Oh well.A side note about the elevators.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Marriott seems to be adding fancy, high speed elevators to it's large hotels."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The first I saw this was at the Marriott Marquis in NYC.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,You enter your desired floor on the keypad OUTSIDE the elevator.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"So, make sure you pay attention!"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Back to the hotel.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The room was small with no view.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The room was very noisy.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I was told that all windows are being replaced with double-paned glass.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Honestly, you can hear people whistling at other people on the street."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Also, construction on the street starts at about 6:30 AM so forget about sleeping in."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Again, I was up early and I don't have a problem with rebuilding."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I took a walk through the hotel.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Frankly, most of the associates didn't acknowledge anyone's presence."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The sole person who convinced me to not leave was one of the security guards.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,She took it upon herself to escort me to the front desk for a room change.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I was informed by several associates and managers that the owners of the hotel (it is my understanding that Marriott owns the people but others own the building) refused to inform guests of the renovations.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"This is inconceivable, especially given that the rate was $30 more per night than at the JW Marriott across the street and that property is completely renovated!"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I was upgraded to a two room suite.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Actually a standard room with a connecting door into a parlor room.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The living space was quite nice.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,"I had two bathrooms, a dining area, couch, wet bar and there is a Murphy bed in the living room so I suppose it would be great for families, or to sell if the place is sold out."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Not likely any time soon.
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,The food and service in the concierge lounge wasn't great.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"OK, the first night, everything was seafood which I don't eat."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Others may love it.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"There were mini crab cakes, shrimp and a big pot of gumbo."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Problem is, the fishy smell overpowered the lounge, and the elevator landing outside."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Fish shouldn't smell fishy or like garbage.
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,It shouldn't really smell at all.
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,Yuck!
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"It looked nice, whatever there was of it."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,"However, when I went to get butter balls for my toast, a piece of glass about 1 inch square was commingled with the butter and landed on my toast."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,I had to go into the little kitchen to find someone to show.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Her response was, oh Ill take care of it."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Not I'm sorry or some other words of concern, just Oh."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Needless to say, breakfast that day, and each subsequent day was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,YUM!
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The restaurant is temporarily located on the 41st floor in what was the fine-dining restaurant pre-Katrina.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"There are a couple sandwiches, some entrees including fish and steak, and appetizers."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"But, dessert-wise, they had cheesecake, chocolate cake and ice cream."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Come on.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"I know it's slow, but this is NOLa, can we at least have bread pudding or something yummy?"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"The turkey club was good, albeit served just on run-of-the-mill white bread, not the advertised sourdough."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When I saw that on the bar menu the second night, I asked the bartender."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,She said never in 20 years has it been on sourdough!
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Prices in the restaurant were reasonable for New Orleans.
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Typical hotel prices, although room service is around $2.00 per item more than the dining room, plus a 21% service charge and tax."
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"That's a little too much if you ask me.Overall, the city is still almost empty which is a shame."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,I haven't been here for some 20 years and I don't recall too much.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,The French Quarter is indecent shape but there are a lot of vacant buildings.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Also, while I remember lots of bars, I didn't remember seeing as many of the, hmm, adult-type places as I did this time."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,"In conclusion, New Orleans needs support."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,It still can be a charming city again and I am sure that new developments (I saw a big TRUMP banner on the cab ride over) will help.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,y problems weren't with the city.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,Most of the people I encountered outside of the hotel were very nice.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,80% of the people IN the hotel couldn't care less about whether guests are there.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,I wanted to shout.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,".I came here to support the city, can you at least PRETEND you are glad I am here??"
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"When I went to the desk to hand in my certificate, both the associate and manager told me I had to call in advance and that the certificate (a print out from the Marriott Rewards Platinum page that says PRINT THIS PAGE AND SURRENDER) was no good since it wasn't the certificate."
0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Frankly I still don't know what they were saying, aside from implying that I am an idiot."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"So, after only 2 nights, I lugged my stuff down the escalator with no help, across the street and checked into the JW a day early."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,We shall see how THAT goes.I won?? return to the Marriott and I suggest they get their act together and inform people of the renovations.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"Out of all the associates I encountered, only two-a female security guard and the aforementioned bartender, were nice."

0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,"Don't let the price fool you-it's better to spend a few extra bucks for cleanliness, a walkable neighborhood without someone asking you for money or cigarettes or whatever they may be looking for."

0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that I'm guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,We thought that was a little odd for a king room.
0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top."
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,The clock radio was not a CD player and it didn't pick up one station.

0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200."

0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,"Although the location is great, not much has been done to insulate the rooms from the noise of nearby union square.I paid just under $200/night for this hotel."
0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"If I hadn't been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, I'd say it was fair."
