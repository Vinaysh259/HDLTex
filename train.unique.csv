"n","","","","","","","","n","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Orlando, we made the reservations and the staff member(Front Desk) was rude and had no interest whatsoever in me or my reservation there, trying to get information from her was like pulling teeth, but this was my first trip to Miami, and the hotel was downtown so I figured how bad could it be after all the price was right about 100.00 bucks, but I did listen to my instinct and made the reservation for only one night, and booked six nights at the quality Inn at the Falls, the front desk clerk there was great who took my reservation, the River Park when we pulled up looked like a dump in need of some serious renovations, not enough space to pull up to and check in while you take your luggage out of the car, no parking except next door in a office tower (Public ) garage, $21.00 a night, While riding back down in the garage elevator, I noticed a sign that said Hyatt Hotel Guest pay $5.00 a night or something like that, When we checked in at the front dest I asked if they had a similar arrangement with the garage and of course the answer was no."
"","","","","","","n","n","n","x","","","","","","","","","","","","n","","","The Girl at the check in desk had no personality and let it be known by her attitude that she was in control, not the customer, the lobby was O.K. but the room was old and outdated, and not the cleanest room I had ever stayed in, much like the Edison Hotel in NYC, I did not feel safe in this hotel, one of only 2 hotels out of Hundreds I have stayed in that I had that feeling, anyhow to make a long story short, I could not wait for checkout the next day for our 20 minute drive to the Quality Inn hotel at the falls outside of Miami on route one, and just as expected from my initial phone conversation with Stanley at that hotel, It was going to be a great stay there, and it was."

"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound."
